Flower Classification using TPU on Google Colab. As a part of Kaggle Getting Started Competition "Petals to the Metal"

**Classifying 104 types of flowers based on their images drawn from five different public datasets. Some classes are very narrow, containing only a particular sub-type of flower (e.g. pink primroses) while other classes contain many sub-types (e.g. wild roses).**

The dataset contains imperfections - images of flowers in odd places, or as a backdrop to modern machinery
